# Start Here

Welcome to CygNet's public GitHub repositories! If you want to learn more about these repositories, including how to contribute or use these repositories for your own projects.

## License

The repositories are provided under the 3-clause BSD license, which is available [here](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause) and at each of the repository roots at LICENSE.txt, unless a different license is provided for technical reasons. It is recommended that you read and understand the implications of the license before working with the contents of the repositories.

## Support

CygNet will not give technical support for the contents of any of these repositories. These resources are provided for various reasons (including as examples or templates) but they are separate from the CygNet product. **Do not contact CygNet Support with questions about the contents of these repositories as they will probably have no clue what your are talking about**. Instead, [submitting an issue on GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/) is the best way to ask for help. We make no guarantees that the issues will be resolved.

## Contributing

You can contribute to any of these repositories by [submitting a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/). Pull requests will be monitored by the owners of the repositories (which should be noted in the respective `README.md`). Pull requests are more likely to be accepted if they improve the quality of the repository and are not overly nitpicky (an example of a pull request that might be rejected is one that changes the names of variables in a script to fit a certain naming convention). `<insert example here at a future date>`
